Introduction to Complexity - Santa Fe Institute
https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/104-introduction-to-complexity

About the Course:
"In this course you'll learn about the tools used by scientists to understand complex systems. The topics you'll learn about include dynamics, chaos, fractals, information theory, self-organization, agent-based modeling, and networks. Youâ€™ll also get a sense of how these topics fit together to help explain how complexity arises and evolves in nature, society, and technology."

Methods:

I will use python and Wolfram Alpha in addition to Netlogo to explore the theory and demonstrations from the course.
